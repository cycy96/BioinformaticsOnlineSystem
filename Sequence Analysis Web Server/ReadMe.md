# Sequence Analysis Web Server 
This is a free and open source platform mainly designed for nucleotide sequences analysis of DNA and proteins.


# What information we provide?
 Length of a DNA and protein sequence

 Number of DNA bases

 Percentage of GC content

 Length of a DNA and Protein sequence

 Sequeunce complement

 Sequeunce reverse complement

 Transcription and Translation Tool: Converts sequences from  DNA to RNA and from this to protein

# Quick Overview
This is the homepage of the website that enables users to analyze their DNA or protein sequences.

This webpage allows users to enter their DNA or protein sequences. Before entering the sequence, users are prompted to specify whether it is a DNA or protein sequence.
Next, users need to type/paste their sequence inside the given space. Click 'Run' to run analysis or 'Reset' to clear the entry form or 'Cancel' to close this webpage.
